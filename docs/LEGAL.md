# Legal: Copyright, Trademark, and Takedown Policy

Not legal advice — consult an attorney for definitive guidance.

## Purpose
This document explains how copyright and trademark issues apply to this repository and describes the takedown/response process for rights holders.

## Key principles
- Non-commercial personal use reduces risk but does not guarantee legality.
- Logos are typically trademarked and often copyrighted as graphic works. Trademark law focuses on "likelihood of confusion"; copyright law protects creative expression.
- This repository is fan-created and not affiliated with any artist, label, or rights holder.

## Repository stance
- Assets are intended for personal, non-commercial use only.
- We do not claim any ownership of third-party logos or artwork.
- Contributors must only submit assets they have the right to contribute.

## Takedown and DMCA "Safe Harbor"
We aim to honor verified takedown requests promptly. If you are a rights holder (or their authorized agent) and believe content in this repository infringes your rights, please provide the following information when contacting the maintainers:

- Identification of the copyrighted work or trademarked logo claimed to be infringed.
- The repository path(s) to the allegedly infringing file(s) (e.g., `artists/<MBID>/logo.png`).
- A statement that you have a good-faith belief the use is unauthorized.
- Your contact information (email and organization).
- A signed electronic statement under penalty of perjury that the information in your notice is accurate and that you are the rights holder or authorized to act on their behalf.

We will acknowledge valid requests, investigate, and remove or restrict access to the specified item(s) promptly if the claim is verified. We may request additional information to validate requests.

## How to submit a takedown request
1. Open a private GitHub Issue titled "Takedown Request" and include the required information above, or email repo maintainers if an email contact is provided in the project metadata.
2. Mark the issue private or request maintainers to treat submission as confidential if necessary; avoid pasting sensitive credentials.

If you prefer, you may use formal DMCA channels through GitHub (see GitHub's DMCA takedown procedures). We respect and will respond to valid formal notices.

## Trademark vs Copyright
- Trademark claims typically ask that a use not imply endorsement or affiliation. If assets are hosted or used in a way that suggests official status, maintainers may remove or rename content or clarify disclaimers.
- Copyright claims relate to copying and distribution of protected artwork. Even fan-created or altered assets may raise copyright concerns.

## Good-faith handling and counter-notices
If a contributor believes their content was removed in error, standard counter-notice procedures may apply (e.g., through GitHub or legal channels). We are not legal counsel and cannot provide legal advice on counter-notices.

## Contributor obligations
By contributing, you confirm you have the right to submit the asset and that it does not violate applicable law or third-party rights. See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for guidance on provenance and attribution.
